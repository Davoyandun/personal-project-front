## Best Practices üìå

- **TypeScript**: We use TypeScript to ensure that our code is type-safe and to provide a better development experience.
- **React Hooks**: We use hooks to manage state and side effects in our components.
- **Reusable Components**: We strive to create reusable components that can be used across the application.
- **Accessibility**: We make sure that our components are accessible to all users.
- **Responsive Design**: We make sure that our components look good on all screen sizes.
- **Testing**: We write tests for our components to ensure that they work as expected.
- **Code Quality**: We use ESLint to ensure that our code is clean and consistent.

## Design Patterns üìå

- **Composite Pattern**: We use the composite pattern to create a tree structure of components.
- **Context Pattern**: We use the context pattern to manage global state in our application.
- **Reactivity**: We use reactivity to update the UI when the state changes.


## Commits Convention

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention to ensure that all commits are easy to read and release notes are easy to generate.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a header, a body, and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, an optional scope, and a subject:

```
<type>[ticket]: <subject>

```

The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.
example: 
  
```
feat[Final-1]: fist commit
```

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit
